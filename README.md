# WikiPagerankDB
sample-boltdb and sample-mysql run, but the mwdumper.jar from the wikipedia source is a better solution to make a database (using mysql) from the wikipedia dump file(s).
tools.go contains an unfinished HMM tagger using the viterbi algorithm - question is if a nerual network is better suited than an in-case enumerator from probabilistic selection dependent on input.
TODO: implement the rake, tf-idf and pagerank (or another algorithm with lower memory consumption) algorithm to select suited articles and nouns from articles based on graph weights and nouns' popularity.

The user should input a desired article, and output should be somewhat like wikibooks - on the road to create an AI assistant for education/learning.
